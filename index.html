    <h2> Favorite Project</h2>
    <p> So far my favorite project i have worked on was creating a program to add students to a class,
        input the students grade, and add them to a class. It was challenging at times but the final result 
        was a chance for me to learn new things and to problem solve. It has become one of my favorite 
        projects because it let me learn to navigate through tough situations and have more knowledge
        on c#.
